Dameo considerations

TODO: make abstract minimax framework so I can check it on e.g. tic-tac-toe.
TODO: check some basic checkers strategies: which squares are important and why?
    is mobility important? etc.
TODO: implement multi-moves. Idea: use recursion for this, where you send along a list
of pieces that has already been captured.
TODO: implement king promotion.
TODO: implement king functionality.


Points to optimize:
Creating new piece set in tree traversal: consider creating black and white pieces
    for each position and have each player have a list with references to pieces
    in this list instead of creating entirely new pieces for each node in the tree.
Set increase in legalSingleMoveGeneration
Keep players' pieces sorted by coordinates so I can do binary search when generating
    capture moves
