Dameo considerations

Multi-jumps zijn waarschijnlijk het beste als één move weer te geven.

Need to model single moves, jumps and multi-jumps.

1. How to represent moves?
Begin met single moves. Which piece to which position?
How to execute moves?
Begin met simpele, legale non-jumping moves.

2. How to generate moves?
3. How to check whether moves are legal?


TODO: check single (capturing) move generation. TIP: maybe we don't have to repeat everything
for black player, maybe we can transpose the board instead?

TODO: refactor single move generation to get rid of code duplication
TODO: implement multi-moves
TODO: implement king promotion


Points to optimize:
Set increase in legalSingleMoveGeneration
Keep players' pieces sorted by coordinates so I can do binary search when generating
capture moves
