Dameo considerations

TODO: check new move generation scheme.
TODO: filter out non-capturing moves in GameEngine.generateLegalMoves(). IDEA:
    first generate capturing moves. If any are found, don't check for regular
    moves.
TODO: check some basic checkers strategies: which squares are important and why?
    is mobility important? etc.
TODO: test basic alpha-beta search implementation on new setup.
TODO: implement multi-moves. Idea: use recursion for this, where you send along a list
of pieces that has already been captured.
TODO: implement king promotion.
TODO: implement king functionality.


Points to optimize:
Creating new piece set in tree traversal: consider creating black and white pieces
    for each position and have each player have a list with references to pieces
    in this list instead of creating entirely new pieces for each node in the tree.
Set increase in legalSingleMoveGeneration
Keep players' pieces sorted by coordinates so I can do binary search when generating
    capture moves
