Dameo considerations

TODO: thing to check next: finding opponent's piece corresponding to a given position.
    I can remove the findPiece method from player now.
TODO: merge new setup into master branch.
TODO: test basic alpha-beta search implementation on new setup.
TODO: implement multi-moves. Idea: use recursion for this, where you send along a list
of pieces that has already been captured.
TODO: implement king promotion.
TODO: implement king functionality.


Points to optimize:
Creating new piece set in tree traversal: consider creating black and white pieces
    for each position and have each player have a list with references to pieces
    in this list instead of creating entirely new pieces for each node in the tree.
Set increase in legalSingleMoveGeneration
Keep players' pieces sorted by coordinates so I can do binary search when generating
    capture moves
