Dameo considerations

TODO: implement successor function
TODO: check if new move generation code works: new way of finding pieces,
    using states, etc.
    
TODO: implement multi-moves
TODO: implement king promotion


Points to optimize:
Creating new piece set in tree traversal: consider creating black and white pieces
    for each position and have each player have a list with references to pieces
    in this list instead of creating entirely new pieces for each node in the tree.
Set increase in legalSingleMoveGeneration
Keep players' pieces sorted by coordinates so I can do binary search when generating
    capture moves
