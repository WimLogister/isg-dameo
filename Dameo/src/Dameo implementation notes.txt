Dameo considerations

TODO: debug multi-piece moves. I'm not pushing the original piece's single move
    onto the stack, this needs to be fixed.
TODO: implement king functionality.
TODO: implement human player. Has to be able to analyse input move.
TODO: try some basic debugging on negamax first.
TODO: make abstract negamax framework so I can check it on e.g. tic-tac-toe.
TODO: check some basic checkers strategies: which squares are important and why?
    is mobility important? etc.

Points to optimize:
Creating new piece set in tree traversal: consider creating black and white pieces
    for each position and have each player have a list with references to pieces
    in this list instead of creating entirely new pieces for each node in the tree.
Set increase in legalSingleMoveGeneration
Keep players' pieces sorted by coordinates so I can do binary search when generating
    capture moves
